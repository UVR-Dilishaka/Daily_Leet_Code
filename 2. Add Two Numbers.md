You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

**Input:**`` l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]``
**Output:**`` [7,0,8]``
**Explanation:** ``342 + 465 = 807.
``
**Example 2:**

**Input:** l1 =`` [0], l2 = [0]``
**Output:** ``[0]``

**Example 3:**

**Input:**`` l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]``
**Output:**`` [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]``

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

# Solution

- push the digits in to stacks 
- pop them each out and append them to a string
- convert the numbers 
- add them
- convert back to numbers 
- add each digit back
